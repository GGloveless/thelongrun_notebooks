The blog where these notebooks were repurposed as posts has shut down. The repository will archive the notebooks for everyone to visit.
List of notebooks:

* [MLE tutorial](MLE_tutorial.ipynb), where it's shown how to develop the *maximum-likelihood estimation* algorithm from scratch using [TensorFlow Probability](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability).
* [MAP tutorial](MAP_tutorial.ipynb), where it's shown how to build the *maximum a posteriori* probability estimation algorithm using TensorFlow Probability.
* [GLM introduction](introduction_glm.ipynb), it shows an intorduction of *generalized linear models* with TensorFlow Probability.
* [EM tutorial](EM_Tutorial.ipynb), it explains how to translate the formulas of the *expectation-maximization* algorithm using TensorFlow.
* [Partial regularization](partial_regularization.ipynb), where it's explained how to apply regularization to a subset of variables in a linear model.
